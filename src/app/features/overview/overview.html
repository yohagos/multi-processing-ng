  <h3>What does MP stand for?</h3>
  <p>
    Until now, I have enjoyed trying my hands on “real-life projects” in order to learn about
    technologies and acquire a certain level of knowledge. Since these usually require more time, I
    decided to set up a multi-processing (MP) backend in Go. The reasons for this are as follows:
  </p>
  <p>- Refreshing my Go knowledge</p>
  <p>- Learn about new Angular (v. 20/21) functionalities</p>

  <h3>Features / Functionalities</h3>
  <p>
    Over time, I plan to add more features, whereby my backend will deliver data via different
    interfaces (groups) and I will format this data and much more.
  </p>

  <p>The groups that have been implemented so far:</p>

  <p>- Users => delivers imaginary user data</p>
  <p>- Crypto => completely imaginary and generated values that are provided via a websocket</p>
